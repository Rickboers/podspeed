# YouTube Conversation Flow Controller

## Overview

The YouTube Conversation Flow Controller is a browser extension designed to enhance your podcast listening experience on YouTube. It dynamically adjusts the playback speed based on the speaker's pace, ensuring a consistent flow of information. This tool is particularly useful for podcasts where speakers have significantly different talking speeds, such as Lex Fridman's interviews.

## Features

- Automatically adjusts video playback speed based on the speaker's words per second rate
- Customizable target words per second
- Smoothly transitions between different playback speeds
- Works in real-time as you watch YouTube videos
- Easy to toggle on/off

## Why Use This Extension?

Many viewers of Lex Fridman's podcasts have noted the stark contrast in speaking speeds between Lex, who tends to speak slowly and deliberately, and some of his guests, like Ben Shapiro, who speak very rapidly. This extension aims to balance these differences, creating a more consistent listening experience.

## How It Works

1. The extension fetches the video's transcript
2. It analyzes the words per second rate for upcoming segments
3. Based on your set target words per second, it adjusts the playback speed
4. The speed changes are applied gradually for a smooth listening experience
